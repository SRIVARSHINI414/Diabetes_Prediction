Implemented a PySpark-based pipeline for diabetes prediction, encompassing thorough data exploration, addressing missing values, and conducting feature analysis. Developed a logistic regression model, performed feature transformation, and evaluated model performance on a test set with subsequent deployment for predictions on new data.
